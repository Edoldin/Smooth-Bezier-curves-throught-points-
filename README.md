# Smooth-Cubic-Bezier-curves-throught-points
An article to learn how to generate the control points of a bezier curve with the condition of be 2 times smooth and through a set of prescribed points.
What a bezier curve is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve
The cubic bezier curve is given by: B(t)=(1-t)^3*P0 + 3*(1-t)^2*t*P1+3(1-t)*t^2*p2+t^3P3
In the definition
